👋 About Me
I’m a tech problem-solver and enthusiast with 4+ years of experience across Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and Business Analysis—building systems, pipelines, and dashboards that drive real impact. I’ve worked with teams at Cognizant, AndX, UConn Health, and now Streamer Stakes, combining strong technical skills with clear communication and a calm, F1-driver-level focus under pressure.

I hold a Master’s in Business Analytics & Project Management from the University of Connecticut (Go Huskies! 🐺🐾), and I’m passionate about turning data into scalable, meaningful solutions.

🔭 What I’m Working On
Right now I’m focused on building AI agents to automate my day—task management, scheduling, reminders, you name it.
I’ve also got a few personal data projects in the pipeline (pun intended 😄), waiting to be revived once life slows down a bit.

🌱 What I’m Learning
Leveling up through hands-on code-alongs in:

Python, SQL, and Spark

Dashboard design with Power BI & Tableau

Graph Databases (Neo4j)

Kubernetes for scalable cloud workflows

I’m also contributing to nonprofit tech efforts—giving back with data.

🌍 A Little Backstory

My tech journey started during my engineering undergrad, fueled by numbers, curiosity, and a commitment to sustainability. I even worked on a hand gesture recognition system using Python and ML.
I still love attending conferences, keeping up with emerging tech, and building systems that are ethical, efficient, and good for the planet.

🫱🏼‍🫲🏼 Let’s Collaborate
Open to teaming up on projects involving:

Scalable data platforms

⚡ In My Free Time
I’m a sports junkie— Watching F1, Basketball, Tennis, and Cricket are my go-tos! I also love hiking and joining local sustainability activities to stay connected to my environmentalist side. If you’re a huge movie lover, hit me up with your favorite character reference so I can catch up.

📫 Let’s Connect!
I’m always down to connect with tech enthusiasts who share my passion for Data Engineering, AI, and sustainable tech. Hit me up about ETL pipelines, data visualization with Power BI or Tableau or breaking into data roles! I’d also love to collaborate on projects around scalable data solutions, AI, or green tech. I’m looking for full-time roles as a Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, or anything that fits my experience in data and cross-functional work. My communication skills and can-do attitude make me a great partner for brainstorming and driving projects forward.
